# Password-Generator
I used the Python programming language to create a script on my MAC OS to generate a password that is 12 characters long in length and includes letters, numbers, and special characters that randomly puts them in different order whenever the request for a password is entered.

I then pull up the Mac OS terminal and access the script in which I have saved in a project folder in my documents to run the code and generate the random passwords
